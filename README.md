# Give Me Credit: Financial Distress Prediction

Welcome to the **Give Me Credit** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to predict the probability of financial distress within the next two years for borrowers, leveraging a dataset of 250,000 records. The notebook uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze historical financial data and generate accurate predictions.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can help identify borrowers who are at risk of financial distress. This can be used by financial institutions to make informed lending decisions and minimize potential risks.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into the data through visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful variables to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing XGBoost for robust and efficient predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing the model using metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and F1-score.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `givemecredit.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from a Kaggle competition, "Give Me Some Credit". It includes anonymized financial information such as income, debt ratio, and credit utilization. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit).

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:
- AUC: 0.95
- Accuracy:
- F1-score: *Insert F1-score value*
